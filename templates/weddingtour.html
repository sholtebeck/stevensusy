<label>Our Wedding Tour:</label><br>We realize that not everyone can make it out for a destination wedding, 
so we're also planning wedding parties for our mainland ohana in June 2017.

<p>First weekend (June 3-4) in the East Bay: Probably an <a href="http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/schedule/?c_id=oak#y=2017&m=6&calendar=DEFAULT">Oakland Athletics</a> game at O.Co Coliseum (they're playing the Nats that weekend).

<br>Plus pre-game or post-game drinks and snacks at Drake's or 21st Amendment in San Leandro.

<p>Sometime the next week (June 6-8) in Wisconsin

<br>Food and drinks at some brewpub in greater Milwaukee (<a href="http://www.lakefrontbrewery.com/">Lakefront</a>, <a href="http://ale-house.com/">Mke Alehouse</a>, open to suggestions)
<br>Or maybe a <a href="http://milwaukee.brewers.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=mil#y=2017&m=6&calendar=DEFAULT">Milwaukee Brewers</a> game at Miller Park (they're hosting the Giants that week).
